/*
 * NoFAT file system: Store files without a partition map!
 *
 * This is most certainly Yet Another Filesystem, so let's keep it simple.
 *
 * The goal is to store animation data files onto small external flash memories.
 * Using FAT was considered first but seemed like more work because of the large
 * sector size and need to write a shim to connect to the flash interface. Don't
 * bother to use this for a large memory or SD card...
 *
 * Designed for use with flash memories with these things in mind:
 * -Small memory (<16MiB), but large sector size (4KiB)
 * -Fast enough to just scan the first bytes of each sector, so no file allocation
 *  table needed
 * -Files are write-once, and the only chance to remove them is to wipe the whole
 *  file
 * -Files are described by a master sector, which contains the length of the file 
 *  as well as sector address(es) of any continuing data
 *
 * There are three kinds of sector:
 * -Free Sector: Sector that is not used
 * -Starting Sector: This sector starts a file. The format of this sector is
 *  described below. There is one starting sector per file
 * -Continuation sector: Sector that contains extended data from a file. This sector
 *  only has data in it. There are 0-n continuation sectors per file.
 *
 *
 * Starting sector layout:
 *
 * 0x0000: Magic number: [0x12]
 * 0x0001: Magic number: [0x34]
 * 0x0002: Magic number: [0x56]
 * 0x0003: Magic number: [0x78]
 * 0x0004: File size in bytes >> 24
 * 0x0005: File size in bytes >> 16
 * 0x0006: File size in bytes >>  8
 * 0x0007: File size in bytes >>  0
 * 0x0008: File type (implementation dependent)
 * 0x0009: Reserved
 * 0x000A: Continuation sector number 1 >> 8, if file size > 3840
 * 0x000B: Continuation sector number 1 >> 0, if file size > 3840
 * 0x000C: Continuation sector number 2 >> 8, if file size > 7936
 * 0x000D: Continuation sector number 2 >> 0, if file size > 7936
 * ... (as required)
 * 0x00FE: Continuation sector number 123 >> 0, if file size > 503552
 * 0x00FF: Continuation sector number 123 >> 0, if file size > 503552
 *
 * Note: With the restriction that the file table reside in the first page,
 *  there is only enough storage space to list 123 continuation sectors, so
 *  the maximum file size is 507648 bytes.
